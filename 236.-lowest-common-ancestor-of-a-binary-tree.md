# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/" %}

分情况讨论后就容易看出是 recursive traversal:

1. each of p, q in one subtree -&gt; root is the LCA
2. p, q in one subtree:
   * p, q in one continuously line -&gt; case 3 
   * p, q in separate subtrees -&gt; case 1 
3. p/q is the root: root is the LCA

> If the current \(sub\)tree contains both p and q, then the function result is their LCA. If only one of them is in that subtree, then the result is that one of them. If neither are in that subtree, the result is None.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # 1. each of p, q in one subtree -> root is the LCA
        # 2. p, q in one subtree
        ## 2.1 p, q in one continuously line -> 3 -> certain root returned
        ## 2.2 p, q in separate subtrees -> 1 -> certain root returned
        # 3. p/q is the root: root is the LCA
        if not root or root == q or root == p:
            return root
        # 3 solved, only 1 or 2 now
        l = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        r = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        if l and r: # case 1
            return root
        else:
            return l if l else r
```
